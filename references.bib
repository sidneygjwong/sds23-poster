	abstract = {A key challenge for automatic hate-speech detection on social media is the separation of hate speech from other instances of offensive language. Lexical detection methods tend to have low precision because they classify all messages containing particular terms as hate speech and previous work using supervised learning has failed to distinguish between the two categories. We used a crowd-sourced hate speech lexicon to collect tweets containing hate speech keywords. We use crowd-sourcing to label a sample of these tweets into three categories: those containing hate speech, only offensive language, and those with neither. We train a multi-class classifier to distinguish between these different categories. Close analysis of the predictions and the errors shows when we can reliably separate hate speech from other offensive language and when this differentiation is more difficult. We find that racist and homophobic tweets are more likely to be classified as hate speech but that sexist tweets are generally classified as offensive. Tweets without explicit hate keywords are also more difficult to classify.},

	abstract = {This paper shows that pretraining multilingual language models at scale leads to significant performance gains for a wide range of cross-lingual transfer tasks. We train a Transformer-based masked language model on one hundred languages, using more than two terabytes of filtered CommonCrawl data. Our model, dubbed XLM-R, significantly outperforms multilingual BERT (mBERT) on a variety of cross-lingual benchmarks, including +14.6\% average accuracy on XNLI, +13\% average F1 score on MLQA, and +2.4\% F1 score on NER. XLM-R performs particularly well on low-resource languages, improving 15.7\% in XNLI accuracy for Swahili and 11.4\% for Urdu over previous XLM models. We also present a detailed empirical analysis of the key factors that are required to achieve these gains, including the trade-offs between (1) positive transfer and capacity dilution and (2) the performance of high and low resource languages at scale. Finally, we show, for the first time, the possibility of multilingual modeling without sacrificing per-language performance; XLM-R is very competitive with strong monolingual models on the GLUE and XNLI benchmarks. We will make our code, data and models publicly available.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a web-based corpus of global language use with a focus on how this corpus can be used for data-driven language mapping. First, the corpus provides a representation of where national varieties of major languages are used (e.g., English, Arabic, Russian) together with consistently collected data for each variety. Second, the paper evaluates a language identification model that supports more local languages with smaller sample sizes than alternative off-the-shelf models. Improved language identification is essential for moving beyond majority languages. Given the focus on language mapping, the paper analyzes how well this digital language data represents actual populations by (i) systematically comparing the corpus with demographic ground-truth data and (ii) triangulating the corpus with an alternate Twitter-based dataset. In total, the corpus contains 423 billion words representing 148 languages (with over 1 million words from each language) and 158 countries (again with over 1 million words from each country), all distilled from Common Crawl web data. The main contribution of this paper, in addition to describing this publicly-available corpus, is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between two sources of digital data (the web and Twitter) as well as their connection to underlying populations.},
